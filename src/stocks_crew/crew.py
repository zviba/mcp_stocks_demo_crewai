# crew.py — the agentic layer, and the MCP *client*.
#
# This is the file the refactor was about. The previous version imported the
# tool functions straight out of mcp_server.py and re-wrapped them with CrewAI's
# @tool decorator, so the agents called Python functions in this process and the
# @mcp.tool() decorators were decoration in the literal sense — no server was
# ever started, no JSON-RPC ever crossed a boundary.
#
# Now the crew is a genuine MCP client: it spawns `python -m stocks_crew.mcp_server`
# as a child process and reaches its tools over real JSON-RPC on stdio, exactly
# the way an external MCP host (Claude Desktop, an IDE, another team's agent)
# would. Nothing in this file knows what the tools *do*; it only knows their
# names, which is the point of the protocol.

# CrewAI's own task guardrail
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# CrewAI ships a `HallucinationGuardrail` that attaches to a Task and is supposed
# to score the task's output for faithfulness before the crew moves on. It is
# wired up here, on whichever tasks ask for it in tasks.yaml, because it is the
# framework-native answer to the question guardrails.py answers by hand — and
# because the comparison is the lesson.
#
# READ THIS BEFORE RELYING ON IT: in the open-source `crewai` package the class
# is a *placeholder*. Its __call__ returns `(True, output)` for every input and
# logs "Hallucination detection is a no-op in open source, use it for free at
# https://app.crewai.com". Threshold and context are stored and ignored. Handed a
# report that says a stock trades at 999999.00 and that you should buy it, it
# passes. Only the hosted platform supplies the real implementation (it installs
# a module-level `_validate_output_hook` that this class defers to).
#
# So this is switched on for what it teaches, and `guardrail_status()` reports
# `enforcing: False` so the UI can say so out loud. The class exists, the wiring
# is real, the check is not — and a no-op guardrail that nobody knows is a no-op
# is worse than no guardrail, because it buys confidence it has not earned. Which
# is the whole argument for the deterministic check in guardrails.py: 190 lines
# of Python that runs everywhere, needs no vendor account, and cannot itself
# hallucinate.

#: Tasks whose YAML carries this key get a HallucinationGuardrail attached. The
#: value is either `true` or a mapping of the constructor's optional arguments
#: (`threshold`, `context`).
