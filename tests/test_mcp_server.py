"""End-to-end MCP tests: launch the server as a subprocess and speak JSON-RPC to it.

This is the regression test that keeps MCP from quietly becoming decorative
again — which is exactly what it was in the previous version of this demo, where
the @mcp.tool() decorators existed but no server was ever started. If someone
removes `mcp.run()`, or prints to stdout anywhere inside the server process, the
handshake here fails.
